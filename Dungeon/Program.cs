Public opinion swayed drastically against the doctor at that point and, after being openly pressed on the matter by the Mayor, he wasn't seen in town again.\n\nA little over a month ago, a group of teenagers wondered on to the property. In front of what looks like some kind of dungeon door that leads underground, they found the body of Dr.Agon with a puncture wound through the abdomin. After 2 officers of The Peace entered the dungeon and never came out, Mayor Amy Stake has decided to put a call out to all the land.\n\nTo anyone willing to enter the dugeon on the Dr. Agon estate, anything of financial significance on the property will be yours as long as what lies inside is destroyed.
